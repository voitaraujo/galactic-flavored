# Galactic Flavored üç¶

A theme for VS Code inspired by [this](https://x.com/Mike_Andreuzza/status/1743749245448925235) amazing color pallet and the [Vesper](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper) theme.

## Examples

### TSX

### Zig

## As for v1...

This theme was made using [this](https://themes.vscode.one/) online tool, which introduced some obnoxious code styles(mostly for specific languages).

I didn't got the chance to test this theme with a wide variety of languages/code structures personally, so some inconsistencies should be expected.

For v2, expect a huge reduction of (redundant)code styles, better git colors for the file tree and improved visual clarity overall.
